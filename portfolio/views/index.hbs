				<h3>Beatitudes</h3>
				<span>
          <strong>Built With: </strong>Node/Express.js, HTML5/CSS3/LESS/JS, Handlebars
        </span>

        <p>
          Beatitudes is a simple Node app that generates quotes and displays books by classic Beat Generation writers.
        </p>

        <p>
           Using Google Sheets concatenation, I created a large array of objects with key-value pairs for each author and over 300 total quotes. Then with the power of <strong>Javascript</strong> & <strong>jQuery</strong>, an on click function would pull a quote based on a predefined author variable and insert it into a div ID. If no author variable was defined, the function would simply loop through the array to display a random quote. Overall, the most challenging part was figuring out the JS functionality and setting  CSS media queries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additional features include <strong>Bootstrap Less</strong>,  <strong>self-rendering SVG animations</strong>, <strong>Animate.css</strong>, <strong>smooth scrolling JS</strong>, and a <strong>Masonry.js</strong> gallery for authors' most popular books, descriptions, and more.
        </p>

        <span class="hide">
          <strong>TL;DR</strong> An app that generates cool quotes. You dig?

        <p>
          Studio Mosaic is a Chicago art collective, digital music label, and independent publisher.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website was a passion project, and the third revision/redesign, for a Chicago-based art collective that I am part of. I built the second revision in 2014 with <strong>Wordpress</strong>, but wanted to fully redesign the site with pure HTML5/CSS3/JS, no CMS attached.
        </p>

        <p>
          I treated this project as a playground to learn more about artsy <strong>web design</strong>, <strong>print & photo layouts</strong>, <strong>media queries</strong>, <strong>css grids</strong>, <strong>typefaces & font-families</strong>, <strong>music platform integration</strong>, and experimental <strong>CSS animations</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong>.

        <p>
          /Mu/sic Chart Generator is a <strong>MEAN</strong> app that allows users to build and share music album flowcharts.
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to collaborate with a team of 5 developers to create a <strong>RESTful</strong> app that allows users to build and share music charts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was assigned to work on the front-end design and development. I used this project to hone my skills with <strong>Gulp</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and <strong>Less</strong>. The project also gave me the opportunity to learn more about <strong>React.js components</strong>, <strong>Last.fm API</strong>, <strong>HTML drag-and-drop</strong> functionality, and database CRUD management with <strong>MongoDB</strong>.

          Caspian is an emergency management app, for any trip. Caspian stores and presents important In-Case-of-Emergency (ICE) info and is meant to be used while outdoors or camping.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first Ruby/Sinatra project. The objective of this pair programming assignment was to create a <strong>Ruby/Sinatra</strong> app that features database CRUD functionality. We used <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and <strong>ActiveRecord ORM</strong> to store our user data.
       </p>

       <p>
         Additional features include <strong> Base64 Reader</strong> for uploading images, <strong>click-to-call links</strong>, and Ruby gem <strong>BCrypt</strong> for hashing passwords.

        <p>
          ROYGBIV (pronounced [ROY-JEE-BIV]) is a color-matching puzzle game. The goal of the game is for a single player to determine the brightest colored row in a moving stack of rows.
        </p>

        <p>
          My favorite part about this project was that I was able to learn a great deal about <strong>jQuery animation</strong>, injecting <strong>HTML data types</strong>, <strong>color theory, RGB, and luminance values</strong>, and so many <strong>JavaScript methods</strong> such as parsing, pushing, splitting, splicing, and Math.random()!
        </p>

        <span class="hide">
          <strong>TL;DR</strong> The player with the best colorvision wins!

				<h3>Nimbus Prints</h3>

        <span>
          <strong>My Etsy shop.</strong>
        </span>

        <p>
          Nimbus Prints is a DIYnamic screenprinting boutique in Chicago. Our fan-based t-shirt designs are inspired by anime, manga, otaku culture, music, film, & more!
        </p>

        <p>
          I first learned about screenprinting in a middle school art class in 2005. It was only a week long project but a friend and I decided to continue this DIY hobby outside of the classroom and never really stopped. At the time, we dug skateboarding, street art, cult movies, and rock music. So we saved up enough money to buy screening kits, cutting boards, and x-acto knives to put our ideas into action. Many mistakes later, we were able to print everything we fancied from Hendrix to Dali to Kerouac to Tarantino. Soon our friends wanted t-shirts for themselves...
        <p>

        <p>
          Fast forward several years and this middle school hobby grew out of my parents' basement, into a makeshift college dorm room, and is now an independent art studio in Chicago known as Nimbus Prints.
        </p>

        <span class="hide">
          <strong>TL;DR</strong> Etsy shop that sells nostalgic t-shirts.
